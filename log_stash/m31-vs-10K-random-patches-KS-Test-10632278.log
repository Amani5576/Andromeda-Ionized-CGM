Submitting Slurm Job for KS Testing of M31 vs 10 thousand Virial Radii analogous to M31. For both Mean and Median.
Note: BG correction in each patch has been acheived for all raw RM, from patch to patch
Saved random points as SkyCoord
(No longer plotting) but collecting of points from each circular patch has begun...
Collection of points by each circular patch on WCS sphere is complete
Getting separation of RM from center of relative patch
Mean and Median calculations have begun
Mean and Median calculations have ended

--------------------------------------------------
Raw RM values

Checking Data Shapes:
  - Combined Random Samples: (27522802,)
  - Specific Region Sample: (1687,)

  KS Statistic (K): 0.3073
  P-value: 0.0000
The two datasets are likely different.
   → Your specific region is statistically distinct from random sky samples.
