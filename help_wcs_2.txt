Python Library Documentation: method all_pix2world in module astropy.wcs.wcs

aallll__ppiixx22wwoorrlldd(*args, **kwargs) method of astropy.wcs.wcs.WCS instance
    Transforms pixel coordinates to world coordinates.
    
    Performs all of the following in series:
    
        - Detector to image plane correction (if present in the
          FITS file)
    
        - `SIP`_ distortion correction (if present in the FITS
          file)
    
        - `distortion paper`_ table-lookup correction (if present
          in the FITS file)
    
        - `wcslib`_ "core" WCS transformation
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    *args
        There are two accepted forms for the positional arguments:
    
            - 2 arguments: An *N* x *naxis* array of coordinates, and an
              *origin*.
    
            - more than 2 arguments: An array for each axis, followed by
              an *origin*.  These arrays must be broadcastable to one
              another.
    
        Here, *origin* is the coordinate in the upper left corner of the
        image.  In FITS and Fortran standards, this is 1.  In Numpy and C
        standards this is 0.
    
    
        For a transformation that is not two-dimensional, the
        two-argument form must be used.
    
    
    ra_dec_order : bool, optional
        When `True` will ensure that world coordinates are always given
        and returned in as (*ra*, *dec*) pairs, regardless of the order of
        the axes specified by the in the ``CTYPE`` keywords.  Default is
        `False`.
    
    
    Returns
    -------
    
    result : array
        Returns the sky coordinates, in degrees.  If the input was a single array and
        origin, a single array is returned, otherwise a tuple of arrays is
        returned.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The order of the axes for the result is determined by the
    ``CTYPEia`` keywords in the FITS header, therefore it may not
    always be of the form (*ra*, *dec*).  The
    `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.lat`, `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.lng`,
    `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.lattyp` and `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.lngtyp`
    members can be used to determine the order of the axes.
    
    Raises
    ------
    MemoryError
        Memory allocation failed.
    
    SingularMatrixError
        Linear transformation matrix is singular.
    
    InconsistentAxisTypesError
        Inconsistent or unrecognized coordinate axis types.
    
    ValueError
        Invalid parameter value.
    
    ValueError
        Invalid coordinate transformation parameters.
    
    ValueError
        x- and y-coordinate arrays are not the same size.
    
    InvalidTransformError
        Invalid coordinate transformation parameters.
    
    InvalidTransformError
        Ill-conditioned coordinate transformation parameters.
